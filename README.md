# team-profile-generator
# Description
This is the final version of my in-terminal team profile generator. The user, when running node index.js in their terminal, will be prompted with several questions regarding their team members, starting with their team manager. When the information for the manager is finished, they will be asked if they would like to add more teammates. If they say yes, they will be asked to select either an engineer or an intern. Whichever they select, the same process will occur; asking several questions regarding whichever option they picked. Whenever they decide not to add more team member, an html page will be generated displaying the members, their roles, and all of the information provided about them. When clicked on, every role's email will open in the client's default email application and begin an email to send to that address. When the engineer's github username is clicked on, it will open their profile in a new tab.
